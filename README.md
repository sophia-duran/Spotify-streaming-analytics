🎧 Sophia Duran’s Spotify Streaming Analytics (2019–2025)

Six Years. Thousands of Plays. One Story in Sound.

This self-directed project visualizes my complete Spotify listening history across six years—from genre phases and daily patterns to artist loyalty and emotional arcs. It turns raw listening data into a narrative of evolving taste, discovery, and memory—where every play counts.
