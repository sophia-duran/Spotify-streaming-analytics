# 🎧 Spotify Streaming Analytics (2019–2025)

This is a personal music analytics project using my extended Spotify listening history over six years. It includes:
- Yearly trends
- Top artists and albums
- Hourly/day-of-week heatmaps
- Location-based listening habits
- Redemption arcs (“skipped at first, loved later”)

> Built in Google Colab. Visualized with Plotly. Data powered by Spotify.
